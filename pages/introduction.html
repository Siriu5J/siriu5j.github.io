								<h2>Course Description</h2>
								<p>As you might have known, A.C.E. does provide a computer science project that is worth 0.5 high school credit. However, I have noticed that the project itself lacked tutorial and detailed guidance on how to utilize the powerful computer productivity software suite. The project is focused on the application side of using computer technology. This alternate computer science elective is based on the A.C.E. computer science project and is meant to focus heavily on the tutorial side. Students are expected to learn the text, take quizzes, and then complete the A.C.E. computer science project with extra requirements that aims to utilize the skills learned from the tutorials.</p>
								<p>In this course, Microsoft Office would be used as the main software suite. However, since most productivity suites resembles one another in many ways, it is possible to complete this course without using Microsoft Office, but please be reminded that the student might need to conduct extra research on certain features that might be offered in a different way on another software suite.</p>
								<p>This computer science elective will be divided into two main topics: computer productivity suite and internet applications. The GCF Learn Free office tutorial will be used as the text for the productivity suite part of this elective while various other online resources will be used for the internet applications part.

								<h2>How to complete this course</h2>
								<p>To complete the course, the student is required to go through the GCF Learn Free tutorials, complete the practice problems and quizzes, and complete the projects. The practice problems are ungraded and are aimed to help the student comprehend and consolidate the materials learned. Therefore, most questions would be open-ended, and sample answers would be provided. The quizzes are available on GCF Learn Free; record the scores from the quizzes. Some of the simpler projects would be single-stepped project with simple goals while other ones might contain multiple parts and would be way more time-consuming. A progress card can be downloaded at the resource page of this website. To complete the course, a student would want to aim for around 1 hours per week for a semester or 2 hours per week for a quarter.</p>
